Welcome to the repository for my personal website front-end project. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while demonstrating my ability to create a responsive and dynamic website that adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices and web browsers.

## Technologies Used

2. Dynamic Elements: Leveraging JavaScript, the website incorporates dynamic features to provide enhanced user interactions and seamless browsing experiences.
3. Media Queries: I have implemented media queries to specifically target and optimize the website's appearance and behavior on both mobile devices and web browsers.
